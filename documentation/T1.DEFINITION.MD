# YouTube for Software Engineering Education

This study considers YouTube videos that contribute to Software Engineering (SE) education worldwide, focusing on content that supports the systematic and disciplined development, operation, and maintenance of software systems. In this work, Software Engineering includes the core phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), such as requirements engineering, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance, as well as related technical and managerial practices. The scope covers programming concepts when presented in the context of software construction, code quality, design patterns, version control, debugging, refactoring, software architecture, DevOps practices, project management, documentation, and quality assurance. Research-oriented topics—such as empirical software engineering, software metrics, AI for software engineering, and software security—are included when directly connected to improving software development processes or systems. Recognizing software as a product, the definition also includes content on product management, release strategies, and SaaS models when clearly tied to the software lifecycle. Excluded are videos focused solely on hardware engineering, purely theoretical topics unrelated to software systems, general technology news without educational depth, isolated coding exercises without engineering context, or business discussions not explicitly connected to software development.
