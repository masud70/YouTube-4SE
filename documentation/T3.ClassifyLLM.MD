# Classify Videos with LLM

Classification with LLM means to feed the title and description of each video to the LLM and get the recommendation if the video is related to software engineering according to the definition described in [Task 1 Definition](T1.DEFINITION.MD).

## Steps

1. <input type="checkbox" checked> Fix the input and output format for the LLM.
2. <input type="checkbox" checked> Prepare some examples to feed the LLM so that it cand understand what it should do.
3. <input type="checkbox" checked> Prepare data to feed the LLM.
4. <input type="checkbox" checked> Prepare a prompt to instruct LLM.
5. <input type="checkbox" checked> Prepare code to apply LLM based on the plan.
6. <input type="checkbox" checked> Fix the data saving format.
7. <input type="checkbox"> Prepare all different prompts and check them with randomly selected 100 video metadata. The best prompt will be applied finally.
8. <input type="checkbox"> Feed LLM and collect data in csv file.
9. <input type="checkbox"> Save all the data.

After catching up on what\u2019s been going on for Omar that took him away from us last week, the boys get down to powerlifting talk. This is a big year for powerlifting, with COVID behind us and the Sheffield ahead, and epic battles to come in both the 93 and 76kg divisions at multiple international competitions. Eric discusses how different it can be to coach athletes at the highest level in powerlifting, where scouting, chips, lot numbers, attempt changes, and other subtle aspects of coaching that normally don\u2019t come into play, make a big difference as only kilos separate world champions from runner ups.  Then, Omar asks Eric about his own competitive aspirations as he\u2019s just started his 2023 contest prep, where he plans to go all the way to INBF\/WNBF worlds in November, while also competing in his first masters powerlifting meet, as he turns 40 this year.\n\n00:00 Intro: The liberation of the Erics and the growing lifting community\nIron Culture Ep. 211- Training Specificity Revisited & New Diet Break Data  https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E-mjbcYDHsU \n15:01 American powerlifting rundown \n29:33 The Game Day Coaching Manual and where does Sheffield fit into the powerlifting landscape?\nSSPT\u2019s Game Day Coaching Manual by Matt Gary\nhttps:\/\/www.supremesportspt.com\/gameday-coaching-manual\n36:01 Sheffield rankings and weight classes in powerlifting\n57:35 The beginning of Eric\u2019s 2023 contest prep\nEric Helms 2023 Prep Vlog #1 https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gZEoSXzJP-M\n1:09:51 Longevity in the game and Eric\u2019s approach to starting prep\n1:20:30 Changing the visual aesthetic and powerlifting during prep?!\n1:38:41 The (tentative) 2023 travel plans for Eric and Omar",

    You are a strict binary classifier for Software Engineering educational content.

    Definition:
    This study considers YouTube videos that contribute to Software Engineering (SE) education worldwide, focusing on content that supports the systematic and disciplined development, operation, and maintenance of software systems. In this work, Software Engineering includes the core phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), such as requirements engineering, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance, as well as related technical and managerial practices. The scope covers programming concepts when presented in the context of software construction, code quality, design patterns, version control, debugging, refactoring, software architecture, DevOps practices, project management, documentation, and quality assurance. Research-oriented topics—such as empirical software engineering, software metrics, AI for software engineering, software engineering for AI, and software security—are included when directly connected to improving software development processes or systems. Recognizing software as a product, the definition also includes content on product management, release strategies, and SaaS models when clearly tied to the software lifecycle. Excluded are videos focused solely on hardware engineering, purely theoretical topics unrelated to software systems, general technology news without educational depth, isolated coding exercises without engineering context, or business discussions not explicitly connected to software development.
